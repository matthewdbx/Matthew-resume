Howdy, HomeAway!

I saw the Design Intern opportunity at HomeAway, and it really excited me. I am particularly interested to work for a company and a team that is all about communication, collaboration, and the creation of innovative products that we can be proud of and fit the customer's needs (free snacks sound  like a great perk as well). When I came across your job posting, I was immediately struck by the amazing opportunities it presented, such as working along senior designers and being able to learn from experts in the field.

For the last few months, I’ve immersed myself in the UX design process. From conducting user interviews, synthesizing findings, and creating wireframes I’ve had the opportunity to explore many aspects of the process. Along this journey, I’ve been able to gain proficiency in a number of tools, such as Sketch, Adobe Photoshop, and InVision. I’ve enjoyed getting to use these programs, and learning how to understand them in order to build my arsenal of creative and problem solving tools. I believe by having a constantly growing knowledge base, it will allow me to solve constantly changing problems.

I believe HomeAway is a place where I can problem solve, create, and learn every day and work with a team who is united in creating the best possible product we can for our customers, to see them happy, and to be proud of what we did. I want to work for a company who seeks to provide their customers with what they need, not what we want and who values transparency and trust. 

I can’t wait for the opportunity to talk to y’all more, I know we could make great things happen! 

Thank you for your time,
	Matthew Banks
